Problem: Online Shop Order Fulfillment


You are tasked with developing a program to streamline the order fulfillment process for an online shop.
The shop receives orders for various products, and your program should handle the following functionalities:


Inventory Management: Keep track of the available quantity of each product in the inventory.
                      When an order is placed, ensure that there is sufficient stock to fulfill the order.


Order Processing: Process the orders as they come in. Update the inventory quantity accordingly and
                  generate a confirmation email to the customer.


Stock Alerts: Monitor the inventory levels and generate alerts when the quantity of a product falls
              below a specified threshold. The alerts should provide the product name and the current
              quantity in stock.


Sales Analytics: Generate sales reports to track the performance of products. This report should include
                 information such as the total sales revenue, the best-selling products, and the
                 least-selling products.

// Rebuilt code after trying to split it for Github without success. I was worried I wouldnt be able to get the original code. 
It actually feels like some details are different but I am happy I was able to make it work again.
